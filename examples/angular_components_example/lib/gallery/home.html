<h1>Material design components for AngularDart</h1>
<h2>
    Powering some of Google's most sophisticated and mission-critical
    applications.
</h2>
<p>
    This productive and stable set of widgets, contributed to by hundreds of
    Googlers, make debugging and deploying your app easier. Strict latency and
    testing policies make these widgets an excellent fit for projects using the
    Angular package.
