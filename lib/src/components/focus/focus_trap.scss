// These styles allow the contents within the focus-trap component to inherit
// the height and max-height of the focus-trap component if the height and
// max-height are set like so:
//
// focus-trap {
//   height: 100px;
//   max-height: 100px;
// }
//
// These styles are needed by the material-dialog component, which uses the focus-trap component.
