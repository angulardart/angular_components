// OK, so here's the thing. The dropdown arrow icon is actually pretty small,
// but it still takes up 24x24px as far as the DOM is concerned. This isn't an
// issue normally because it's all whitespace, so it looks fine.
//
// But in Chrome, the actual shape will be revealed if you tab into the dropdown
// button, and it's pretty ugly. Setting overflow:hidden on the button will fix
// that -- but then that breaks baseline alignment in Firefox!
//
// So here's a ridiculous hack to make it look nice in both Chrome and Firefox.
