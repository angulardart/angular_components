// How to use me:
//
// This set of scss files should never output any css unless sass classes are
// extended in the importing file. This allows you to import _material without
// bloating the css files for your components. All variables and components
// within the material stylesheet are prefixed with "mat-" in order to give a
// clear distinction between them and the styles in components that are using
// these material styles.

// Behold, the import of all things:
@import 'const/global',
        '../shared/shared';
