/// Material FAB is a Floating Action Button. It is round, and behaves mostly
/// the same as a MaterialButton.
///
/// It may be flat or raised. A raised button is styled with a shadow.
///
/// __Styling:__
///
/// The preferred way of specifying FAB colors is to use mixins:
///
/// ```
/// /* Make #myButton green with yellow icon */
/// @include button-background-color('#myButton', green);
/// @include icon-button-color('#myButton', yellow);
/// ```
///
/// The advantage of using mixins for color is that they will not overwrite the
/// disabled state colors. You can also style the FAB with CSS as you would a
/// normal DOM element, although this will also affect the disabled state:
///
/// ```
/// /* Make #myButton green with yellow icon */
/// #myButton {
///   background: green;
///   color: yellow;
/// }
/// ```
///
/// By default the ripple is the same color as the foreground at 25% opacity.
/// You may customize the color using this selector:
///
/// ```
/// /* Make #myButton use a blue ripple instead of foreground color */
/// #myButton material-ripple {
///   color: blue;
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The opacity of the ripple is not customizable via CSS.
