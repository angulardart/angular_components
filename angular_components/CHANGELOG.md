## 0.8.0

 * Move entry points to all components out of the lib/src/ directory.
 * Remove all precompiled .css files.
 * Update all import statements in .scss files to use dart style package
   imports.
 * Add dependency on sass_builder package to compile .css files.

## 0.7.1

 * Add Material Auto Suggest Input component.
 * Material Checkbox: Fix disabled state to match material-spec which is a light
   grey not a certain opacity of the checkbox.

 * Material Input:
   * Add selectAll function for calling the underlying input element's select
     method that focuses the input and selects all its content.
   * Add ability to update the data on a change instead of keypress or blur for
     the standard Material Input.
   * Remove error color from floating label to conform to material spec.
 * Material Popup:
   * Fix mismatch between the variable used as a reference point for
     repositioning the popup and the variable used to initially set the popup's
     position. This caused issues when the tab was in the background because
     these variables could have changed significantly before the next animation
     frame fired (since requestAnimationFrame is throttled when the tab isn't
     visible).
   * Use `_sourceDimensions` instead of `layoutRects[1]` to take overlay
     container offset into account. Using popupSourceLayoutStream directly
     caused issues when the .acx-overlay-container offset was not (0, 0).
 * Material Select: Fix orientation when groups are used.
 * Scorecard:
   * Fix styling for extra-big cards.
   * Fix to allow selectable scorecards in a "custom" scoreboard.
   * Add a tooltip field enabling scenarios where more information about the

   mouse or touch input compared to the previous default of 4px.

 * Remove link hover style.
 * Migrate uses of `ElementRef` to `Element`.
 * Remove `visibility: Visibility.none` from all components since compatibility
   is not yet fully supported. Will be added in an upcoming release.
 * Update documentation.

   without using the attribute.

 * Material Popup:
   * Remove `PopupEvent` and reduce asynchrony.

     positioned.
   * Remove unused `contenWidth` and `contentHeight`.
 * Material Radio: Avoid selecting null when the new selected value is not found
   in the options.
 * Material Tab:
   * Fix logic for the active tab when tabs themselves are changed. Before logic
     was activating/deactivating based on index, but when tabs change the index
     has probably changed.
   * Make mixin to allow text wrapping.
 * Material Tree:
   * Fix bug where state of material tree option cannot be changed by selection
     model.
   * Fix bug where tree_dropdown_select did not auto open correctly using focus.
