[Material design] components for [AngularDart]. Powering some of Google's most
sophisticated and mission-critical [applications].

The [AngularDart Components Gallery] contains live examples and documentation.

This productive and stable set of widgets, contributed to by hundreds of
Googlers, make debugging and deploying your app easier. Strict latency and
testing policies make these widgets an excellent fit for projects using the
Angular package.

## Required Fonts

Add the folowing font downloads to the head element on your page.

### Roboto Font

The typography Sass mixins for are designed to work best with the Roboto font.
[Example](https://github.com/dart-lang/angular_components/blob/7f254c89cbbd512cc284a7e9d03bb687f9948bd9/angular_gallery/lib/builder/template/index.html.mustache#L9)

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  type="text/css"
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700">

```

### Material Icon Font

These components depend on the Material Icon font.
[Example](https://github.com/dart-lang/angular_components/blob/7f254c89cbbd512cc284a7e9d03bb687f9948bd9/angular_gallery/lib/builder/template/index.html.mustache#L11)

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  type="text/css"
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons">
```

## Custom component styles

The styles of these components can be customized in your project with a
component's provided [Sass mixins](http://sass-lang.com/guide#topic-6).

1. Add a dev dependency on the
[sass_builder](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/sass_builder) package to your
`pubspec.yaml`:

  ```yaml
  dev_dependencies:
    sass_builder: ^2.0.0 # update for the latest version
  ```

2. Now you can import styles and mixins from this package via dart style package
imports in your Sass files.

  In your `.scss` files:

  ```scss
  @import 'package:angular_components/css/material/material';

  .blue {
    color: $mat-blue;
  }
  ```
