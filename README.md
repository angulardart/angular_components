[Material design] components for [AngularDart]. Powering some of Google's most
sophisticated and mission-critical [applications].

The [AngularDart Components Gallery] contains live examples and documentation.

This productive and stable set of widgets, contributed to by hundreds of
Googlers, make debugging and deploying your app easier. Strict latency and
testing policies make these widgets an excellent fit for projects using
[AngularDart].
