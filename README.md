## Preview Release

These are the AngularDart components that Google uses to build the
sophisticated, mission-critical apps that bring in much of Google’s revenue.

This productive and stable set of widgets, contributed to by hundreds of
Googlers, make debugging and deploying your app easier. Strict latency and
testing policies make these widgets an excellent fit for AngularDart projects.

Only a small fragment of all the components is available right now. We want
developers to be able to use the package as soon as possible.

in your SASS files.


> NOTE: These .scss files are not used during the build step, but we are
> planning to add this support. See
